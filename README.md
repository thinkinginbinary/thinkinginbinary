The same financial areas also lead to the shaping of individual viewpoints/perspectives of governmental/non governmental individuals organisations & so on. 

At a quantitative level fear led trading activity by individuals/organisations can lead to reduced trading activity/less prosperous algorithmic trading & reduced business asset management activity. Letting fear dictate markets/market decision making is a historical/present day recipe for disaster which can be seen in historrcal time periods of reduced economic growth. By focusing on job security/the connection to finances fear & emotional reactions may become the dominant motivator of financial, market, & economic decision making for many people. When shifting from focusing on the job security connection with financial markets to job changes/job transference, this shift can help transform fear based behaviors to positive behaviours, increase volume of managed assets, facilitate increased volumes of tradig transactions while likely reducing the sometimes negative economic affects of new financial technology, technology in general due to a resultant better understanding of the effects of new technology solutions.  These are a glimpse of the types of personal qualitative discoveries/realizations that have motivated Matt to pursue working within World Economics, Finance, International Communication, Quantitative Finance, Software Engineering & Trading.
